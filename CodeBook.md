#Code Book for HAR Data

**Column Name: Activity**
Contains a factor with six levels
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

This label corresponds to the activity the subject was performing during the observation

**Column Name: Subject**
Contains a factor with 30 levels sequentially numbered 1:30

This label corresponds to the 30 individuals who participated in the study

**All other columns** are generated observations from a subjects Samsung Galaxy S2's gyroscope and accelerometer while performing the activity indicated.
The units of measurement for all observations made by the accelerometer are standard gravity units 'g'.
All gyroscopic readings are an angular velocity measured in radians/second.

The following is copied verbatim from the original data's Code Book:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
>
>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
>
>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
>
>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
>'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

From these observations, the original data contains means and standard deviations which are indicated as the last portion of the column names.
